(ApplicationStructure.md)[ApplicationStructure.md] Please read this document in its entirety so that you can understand the structure of our app. 

You should use your tools to read any files that you need more information about in making your recommendations.

Please always think step by step and carefully before proposing code changes. Please never modify any code that isn’t immediately pertaining to the edit we are making. Please never guess at a solution. I would rather spend time designing and identify the problem absolutely than to guess.

All code changes should strictly follow SOLID (Single responsibility, Open–closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, Dependency inversion) principles.  Use TDD (Test Driven Development).  Update the (README.md)[README.md] when necessary.  Verify that all dependencies are correct.

If you do notice something that looks off, please point it out to me and we can discuss editing it.

And as always, I love working with you. We have a lot of fun together.

For this request, please think about the request and confirm to me that you understand what is being asked and propose your solution. After we have confirmed the solution makes sense, I will ask you to code it.
